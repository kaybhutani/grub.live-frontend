It's Super Quick, Simple, Free, and Easy to Setup. </p>\n        <br></br>\n        <h2>How are we different ?</h2>\n        <p>Although there are some solutions to the QR menu, but all of them are paid and they are doing more than it is required!<br></br>You neither want to replace waiters with robots or have customers order through app even when they are physically present in the restaurant! Your restaurant simply needs a QR menu for now and we promise to provide it for free forever! </p>\n      </div>\n      <br></br>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default About"],"sourceRoot":""}
